########Fit a regression and present well-formatted results from the regression (1 pt) ####The regression doesn’t have to be of any particular scientific interest, and you don’t have to interpret it in any particular way ####You may use {broom} or {gtsummary} or both ###IDK

```{r}

model <- multinom(age ~ coffee_a_personal_preference +
										coffee_b_personal_preference +
										coffee_c_personal_preference +
										coffee_d_personal_preference,
									data = coffee_survey)
tbl_regression(model)

###multinomial model
library(nnet)

tbl_regression(model)


```

```{r}
