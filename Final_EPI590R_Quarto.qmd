Project Title –\>The Great American Coffee Taste Test

In October 2023, \["world champion barista" James Hoffmann\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0) and \[coffee company Cometeer\](https://cometeer.com/pages/the-great-american-coffee-taste-test) held the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" on YouTube, during which viewers were asked to fill out a survey about 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer for the tasting. \[Data blogger Robert McKeon Aloe analyzed the data the following month\](https://rmckeon.medium.com/great-american-coffee-taste-test-breakdown-7f3fdcc3c41d).

For this project, I used the data coffee_survey. most of the variables were character variables except the coffee preference. For regression, I used multinomial because there were more than 2 categories. As for the function, I wanted to make one than can count the mode because the numerical variable is rankings, so it would make more sense to count the mode.

I wanted to make a function to find mode because it thought that would made the most sense.

```{r}
#Write and use a function that does something with the data (1 pt)

#It could be as simple as, for example, a new function that you write by hand
#to calculate the standard deviation of a variable (like we did with the mean)

#you're making a new function called 'get_mode'
get_mode <- function(x) {
	unique_x <- unique(x)
	unique_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, unique_x)))]
}

# Calculate mode for each coffee preference
mode_coffee_a_preference <- get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_a_personal_preference)
mode_coffee_b_preference <- get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_b_personal_preference)
mode_coffee_c_preference <- get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_c_personal_preference)
mode_coffee_d_preference <- get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_d_personal_preference)


# Print the results
print(paste("Mode of Coffee A Preference:", mode_coffee_a_preference))
print(paste("Mode of Coffee B Preference:", mode_coffee_b_preference))
print(paste("Mode of Coffee C Preference:", mode_coffee_c_preference))
print(paste("Mode of Coffee D Preference:", mode_coffee_d_preference))



```

The most popular rating for Coffee A is `r as.integer(get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_a_personal_preference))` on a scale of 1-5.Coffee B's mode rating is `r as.integer(get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_b_personal_preference))`\` Coffee C's is `r as.integer(get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_c_personal_preference))`Coffee D's is `r as.integer(get_mode(coffee_survey$coffee_d_personal_preference))`
